# Problem Statement

A company wants to expand its product line and wants to target students for marketing. To further narrow down their target market and identify possible categories to explore for their products, the company wants to understand the categories where students spend their money and what kind of students spend on the different categories.

The dashboard can allow the company to answer the following questions:
- What category to explore to develop a product?
- Which categories do students spend the most amount of money on?
- Which students have the highest monthly income - based on their gender, year of school and major?
  

# Steps Followed
Step 1: Download dataset and clean data. (Data taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumanthnimmagadda/student-spending-dataset/data) 

Step 2: Load cleaned data into PowerBI in csv format. Select entire dataset.

Step 3: Use charts such as line & stacked column chart and pie chart to visualise data according to the problem questions.

Step 4: Add cards for the different categories where students spend their money.

Step 5: Add slicers with various classifiers such as gender, year of study and major. These slicers can be used individually or together based on the level at which we want to see results. This allows us to view the charts and cards with respect to specific groups of students.
